# About Me
My name is Victoria Jackson and I am a second-year MSPPM with a concentration in Urban and Regional Economic Development. I grew up as a military kid moving across the United States, but I most recently hail from the land of Cheerwine and Bojangles (otherwise known as North Carolina). I graduated from Davidson College in 2012 with the idea that I would pursue a career in education, or at least working with kids. To that end, I taught in a middle school for two years before working as a Teen Services Specialist at ImaginOn, a branch of Charlotte-Mecklenburg Library. My experiences working in those environments led me to pursue a public policy degree for reasons that are probably too long to sum up in this introduction. I'll just say that my goal now is to provide opportunities for communities that haven't had access to them. 

Other than that, the essentials about me: I love burgers, live theater, and singing way off-key in my car. My current hobbies include muay thai and improving my Spanish fluency. And... 

# What I Hope to Learn
...I hope to improve upon the skills that I learned in my prior GIS class! As a visual learner, I really appreciate the power of being able to visualize data to make information accessible to as many people as possible. Given this, I really hope to learn how to effectively visualize map data across multiple platforms so I can do this work without relying one type of software. 

As a policy student, I hope to learn more about the ethics behind collecting mapping data; particularly when people are not aware of how much of their personal data they are giving up. Having not taken any technology/privacy courses, I hope this class can serve as a start to understanding the ins-and-outs of this subject.

## Lab Assignment: Geographic Footprint ##
__Assignment: Use the open-source, geospatial tool [Kepler](https://kepler.gl/) to map [412 Food Rescue](https://412foodrescue.org/) pick-up and delivery data.__

The following screenshots are of maps analyzing volunteer trips from point of origin to destination over multiple months. The blue arcs signify the origins and the red arcs the destinations of the pick-ups.

## Lab Assignment: Custom ArcGIS Map ##
__Assignment: Create a custom ArcGIS basemap style based on something interesting or inspiring__

The following are screeshots of a customized map style inspired by a food people think they enjoy, but is also kind of a bummer.

## Lab Assignment: Mapbox
__Assignment: Build an online map from scratch using Mapbox.__

The map included found in this [link](https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/jacksonvict/ck8o3sjcm37x51is66x8hys4f.html?fresh=true&title=view&access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoiamFja3NvbnZpY3QiLCJhIjoiY2s4NmZzajQzMGY0MTNmbGo0anMzZXdvaiJ9.f2oyXTDNtXVS76FqydAVwA) highlights the distribution of 2017 U.S. age-adjusted rate of drug overdose death rates by state and the U.S. county prescribing rates for 2017. Data for both the [drug overdose rates](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/statedeaths.html) and the [county prescribing rates](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/maps/rxcounty2017.html) were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
