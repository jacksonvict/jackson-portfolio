Working portfolio for Advanced GIS (Spring 2020).

# About Me
My name is Victoria Jackson and I am a second-year MSPPM with a concentration in Urban and Regional Economic Development. I grew up as a military kid moving across the United States, but I most recently hail North Carolina. I graduated from Davidson College in 2012 with the idea that I would pursue a career working with youth. To that end, I taught in a middle school for two years before working as a Teen Services Specialist at ImaginOn, a branch of Charlotte-Mecklenburg Library. My experiences working in those environments led me to pursue a public policy degree for reasons that are probably too long to sum up in this introduction. I'll just say that my goal now is to provide opportunities for communities that haven't had access to them. 

# Why Advanced GIS
I appreciate the power of visualizing data to convey information in an accessible manner to as many people as possible. What is more accessible than the neighborhoods, cities, states, and countries in which you live? With this ethos, I took Advanced GIS to expand my mapping toolkit within ArcGIS as well as open-source web programs such as Kepler and Mapbox. Examples of this work are highlighted in the portfolio below.

# Portfolio



## Lab Assignment: Geographic Footprint ##
__Assignment: Use the open-source, geospatial tool [Kepler](https://kepler.gl/) to map [412 Food Rescue](https://412foodrescue.org/) pick-up and delivery data.__

The following screenshots are of maps analyzing volunteer trips from point of origin to destination over multiple months. The blue arcs signify the origins and the red arcs the destinations of the pick-ups.

## Lab Assignment: Custom ArcGIS Map ##
__Assignment: Create a custom ArcGIS basemap style based on something interesting or inspiring__

The following are screeshots of a customized map style inspired by a food people think they enjoy, but is also kind of a bummer.

## Lab Assignment: Mapbox
__Assignment: Build an online map from scratch using Mapbox.__

This [Mapbox map](https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/jacksonvict/ck8o3sjcm37x51is66x8hys4f.html?fresh=true&title=view&access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoiamFja3NvbnZpY3QiLCJhIjoiY2s4NmZzajQzMGY0MTNmbGo0anMzZXdvaiJ9.f2oyXTDNtXVS76FqydAVwA) highlights the distribution of U.S. age-adjusted rate of drug overdose death rates by state in 2017 and the U.S. county prescribing rates in 2017. Data for both the [drug overdose rates](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/statedeaths.html) and the [county prescribing rates](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/maps/rxcounty2017.html) were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
